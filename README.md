# [2024 IAIFI Astro ML Hackathon](https://iaifi.org/hackathon.html)

Starter materials and tutorials for the 2024 IAIFI Astro ML Hackathon.

## 1. Generative everything
**Facilitator: Carol Cuesta-Lazaro**

Understand the generative model paradigm, and learn how to train diffusion generative models for a dataset of your choosing. Explore their utility for emulation, likelihood evaluation, posterior estimation, and anomaly detection.


## 2. Simulation-based everything
**Facilitator: Siddharth Mishra-Sharma**

Build up the tools necessary to do simulation-based (or likelihood-free) inference. If you have a forward model or simulator for your data and are sick of losing information by using summary statistics, this may be for you!

## 3. Multimodal everything 
**Facilitator: Siddharth Mishra-Sharma and Alex Gagliano**

Understand how to train joint embeddings across or within modalities. Examples: (1) images + spectra + light curves, or (2) the same object observed by different instruments. Explore the structure of joint embeddings and how to use them for various downstream tasks. Bring your own multi-modal datasets!

## 4. Anomaly Detection
**Facilitator: Alex Gagliano and Daniel Muthukrishna**

Extract informative features and build lower-dimensional representations of your dataset to find the rarest and strangest instances! Weâ€™ll hack models for zero-shot and few-shot learning.

## 5. Super resolution everything
**Facilitator: Yueying Ni**

Enhancing the resolution of simulations that are too expensive to run at high resolution, for example hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation.
